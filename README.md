## Overview 👋
Welcome to the **Capstone project** that concludes my journey with Epicode.\
This project showcases the skills I acquired during the Data Analyst course, using various tools and technologies to **model and analyze data**. 📚


## Project Objective 🎯
In this project, I analyzed **Tech Salaries** over the last 5 years.\
The analysis was conducted using various advanced techniques and tools to ensure a thorough understanding of **salary trends**.

## Dataset 📁

The initial main dataset consisted of only one fact table.
\
After further research and analysis, I was able to create additional dimensions to **normalize the dataset** and improve the overall analysis.

**Note:** The data is primarily collected in the U.S., so analyses related to this nation are more detailed and accurate.
# Tools Used 🛠️

## Python 🐍

- **PANDAS:** Used for data manipulation and analysis. I loaded the data from .csv files, which initially contained only the fact table, and created additional dimension tables
- **SEABORN:** Used for creating advanced statistical visualizations

## MySQL 🗄️

- **RDBMS:** Created a relational database to store data extracted from .csv files
- **DDL:** Used to define the structure of the database, including tables and indexes
- **DML:** Used for inserting, updating, and deleting data

## Power BI 📊

- **POWER QUERY:** Used for data import, transformation, and integration.
- **DAX:** Used to create calculated measures and custom columns.
- **DATA VISUALIZATION:** Created interactive dashboards to present the analysis results in a clear and intuitive way.


## Google Looker Studio 📈

- **JOIN:** Used to combine data from different sources
- **DATA VISUALIZATION**: Created interactive dashboards to present the results clearly and comprehensibly

## Excel 📑

- **POWER QUERY:** Was employed to import, transform, and combine data from different dimension tables and the fact table
- **POWER PIVOT:** Besides Power Query, I used Excel to create charts showing some of the key trends identified in the analysis.

# Results and Analysis 📊

The Analysis Results show **Interesting Trends**, including:

📈 **General increase** in salaries over the years

🌍 **Salary differences** between continents and countries

💼 **Salary variations** among different occupations based on seniority.

# Conclusion 🏁

This project represents the **culmination of my learning journey** as a Data Analyst and demonstrates my ability to use advanced tools and techniques for data analysis.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or anything else, please do not hesitate to **contact me!**

**Have fun with the data analysis!** 🚀
