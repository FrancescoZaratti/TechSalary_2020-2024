Hello 👋

Welcome to the Capstone Project that completes my journey with Epicode.
This project shows the skills I acquired during the Data Analyst course, using the tools studied to model and analyze data. 📚

In this project I analyze tech salaries for the last 5 years.

You will find initial csv files, Python file for data analysis and visualizations that tell fascinating stories.

Interactive dashboards were created with Power BI and Looker Studio, while Excel was used to manipulate and visualize the data in a more traditional way.

In addition, I created a MySQL database with the data extracted from the CSV files, designed a logic model, and and created some demonstration views to deepen the analysis. 📊

The results show interesting trends such as the general increase in salaries over the years, differences between continents, countries and salary changes among different occupations based on seniority. 💼 

N.B. The data are mostly collected in the U.S., so the analyses in this nation are more detailed and accurate.

If you have any questions, suggestions or anything else, please do not hesitate to contact me on LinkedIn 🌍

Have fun with the data analysis! 🚀
