Capstone Project - Data Analyst Course

Overview 👋

Welcome to the Capstone project that concludes my journey with Epicode. This project showcases the skills I acquired during the Data Analyst course, using various tools and technologies to model and analyze data. 📚

Project Objective 🎯

In this project, I analyzed tech salaries over the last 5 years. The analysis was conducted using various advanced techniques and tools to ensure a thorough understanding of salary trends.

Dataset 📁

The initial main dataset consisted of only one fact table. After further research and analysis, I was able to create additional dimensions to normalize the dataset and improve the overall analysis.
Note: The data is primarily collected in the U.S., so analyses related to this nation are more detailed and accurate.

Tools Used 🛠️

Python 🐍

- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis. I loaded the data from CSV files, which initially contained only the fact table, and created additional dimension tables.
- Seaborn: Used for creating advanced statistical visualizations.

MySQL 🗄️

- RDBMS (Relational Database Management System): Created a relational database to store data extracted from CSV files.
- DDL (Data Definition Language): Used to define the structure of the database, including tables and indexes.
- DML (Data Manipulation Language): Used for inserting, updating, and deleting data.
- Logical Model: Designed a logical model to organize data in a structured manner, following the star schema to facilitate analytical queries.

Power BI 📊

- Power Query: Used for data import, transformation, and integration.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used to create calculated measures and custom columns.
- Data Visualization: Created interactive dashboards to present the analysis results in a clear and intuitive way.

Looker Studio 📈

- Join: Used to combine data from different sources.
- Data Visualization: Created interactive dashboards to present the results clearly and comprehensibly.

Excel 📑

- Power Query: Was employed to import, transform, and combine data from different dimension tables and the fact table.
- Traditional Charts: Besides Power Query, I used Excel to create charts showing some of the key trends identified in the analysis.

Results and Analysis 📊

The analysis results show interesting trends, including:

📈 General increase in salaries over the years.
🌍 Salary differences between continents and countries.
💼 Salary variations among different occupations based on seniority.

Conclusion 🏁

This project represents the culmination of my learning journey as a Data Analyst and demonstrates my ability to use advanced tools and techniques for data analysis.
